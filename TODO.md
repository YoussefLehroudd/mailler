# Stop Functionality Implementation - TODO

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Backend.php - Stop Flag Implementation
- [x] Added global `$stopSending` variable initialization (set to `false`)
- [x] Improved stop check at loop start with better visual feedback
- [x] Improved stop check after email sending with better visual feedback
- [x] Added `clearstatcache()` before each file check to avoid caching issues
- [x] Changed stop message to be more visible (red color, bold, larger font)
- [x] Used `@unlink()` to suppress errors when deleting stop file

### 2. Stop Mechanism Features
- [x] File-based flag system using session ID: `mailer_stop_[session_id]`
- [x] Two strategic stop checks in the sending loop:
  - At the beginning of each iteration (before processing email)
  - After sending each email (before continuing to next)
- [x] Immediate break from loop when stop is detected
- [x] Proper cleanup of stop file after detection

## üìù How It Works

### Stop Flow:
1. **User clicks "Stop" button** ‚Üí JavaScript sends request to `stop.php`
2. **stop.php creates flag file** ‚Üí `mailer_stop_[session_id]` in temp directory
3. **backend.php checks flag** ‚Üí At two points in the loop:
   - Before processing each email
   - After sending each email
4. **When flag detected** ‚Üí 
   - Sets `$stopSending = true`
   - Displays stop message
   - Deletes flag file
   - Breaks out of loop immediately

### Key Variables:
- `$stopSending` - Global flag variable (false by default)
- `$stop_file` - Path to the stop flag file
- File location: `sys_get_temp_dir()/mailer_stop_[session_id]`

## üîß Technical Details

### Stop Checks Location:
1. **Loop Start** (Line ~5380): Before email processing
2. **After Send** (Line ~5480): After successful email send

### Cache Clearing:
- Uses `clearstatcache(true, $stop_file)` before each check
- Ensures fresh file system status

### Visual Feedback:
- Red color (#dc3545)
- Bold text
- Larger font (16px)
- Clear stop icon (‚õî)

## üéØ Next Steps (Optional Improvements)

- [ ] Add stop confirmation dialog in UI
- [ ] Add statistics display (emails sent before stop)
- [ ] Add resume functionality
- [ ] Log stop events to file

## üìå Notes

- Stop functionality works with both BCC and regular sending modes
- Compatible with SMTP rotation feature
- Works with pause/reconnect features
- Session-based to prevent conflicts between multiple users
